// Lifted from quake-1-re-ts src/lib/bot_brain/rng.ts at commit f57aadb (U20), the
// game-agnostic bot brain. Verbatim apart from this line, the import paths
// that changed with the directory, and the three parameterizations listed
// in src/server/bots/nav_adapter.ts's header (NAV2-specific graph
// construction, run/walk speeds, weapon-selection command).
// The brain never calls Math.random: every decision that rolls a die takes
// its numbers from a `BotRandomT` the caller injects, so a fixed seed
// replays a bot's whole match exactly. src/bots seeds one generator per bot
// slot; the tests seed theirs by hand.

 * Warm-up draws thrown away at construction, before the caller sees any of
 * them. xorshift32 mixes a seed's bits through its three shifts (13, 17, 5)
 * one call at a time, and a small seed's few set bits take several calls to
 * reach the whole 32-bit word: seeded 1 through 8, every one of them rolls
 * the same "true" out of its first two calls to `randomChance(rng, 25)`,
 * which skews anything gated on an early roll (a bot's character pick, its
 * attacker/defender split) whenever seeds are handed out as small sequential
 * integers rather than full-width random words. Measured against seed vs.
 * seed+1's state words, the two have converged to roughly half their bits
 * differing (full avalanche) by the fifth discarded call; eight keeps a
 * comfortable margin over that. This only changes what a given SEED produces
 * -- an unseeded generator's long-run behavior is the same either way -- so
 * every test and savegame that pins a seeded sequence's values gets new
 * ones.
