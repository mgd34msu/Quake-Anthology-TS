// Lifted from quake-1-re-ts src/lib/bot_brain/aim.ts at commit f57aadb (U20), the
// game-agnostic bot brain. Verbatim apart from this line, the import paths
// that changed with the directory, and the three parameterizations listed
// in src/server/bots/nav_adapter.ts's header (NAV2-specific graph
// construction, run/walk speeds, weapon-selection command).
// The aim tracker: settings_PC.txt's `aiming.*` block, run as a
// spring-damper on the pitch and yaw axes.
//
// Each axis carries an angular velocity. Every frame the spring pulls the
// view toward the ideal angle with `spring_stiffness` and bleeds that pull
// with `damping`:
//
//     accel    = stiffness * error - damping * velocity
//     velocity = clamp(velocity + accel * dt, +/- max_acceleration)
//     angle    = angle + velocity * dt
//
// READING `aiming.max_acceleration`. The retail comment calls it "max angle
// acceleration allowed per second", but the six shipped values (180, 225,
// 315, 360, 480, 720) only make a coherent skill ladder when they clamp the
// view's angular SPEED in degrees per second, not its acceleration. As a
// speed clamp, practice needs half a second to swing 90 degrees and
// nightmare needs an eighth of one -- the intended spread. As an
// acceleration clamp, the same six values give 1.41s and 0.71s: nightmare
// would aim barely twice as fast as practice, and the five other tuned
// `aiming.*` keys would have almost no effect, because the clamp would
// dominate every one of them (the spring wants 3600 deg/s^2 for a
// 90-degree error at the softest stiffness, twenty times the softest
// clamp). Clamped as a speed, the spring stays in charge and the six
// stiffness/damping pairs produce the six distinct settling behaviours they
// were obviously tuned for: damping ratios of 0.40, 0.65, 0.84, 0.89, 0.79
// and 0.67 against natural frequencies of 6.3 to 22.4 rad/s. This is the
// one place in the brain where a shipped comment is read against its
// literal wording, and it is called out here rather than left silent.
//
// `aiming.velocity_offset` is in seconds and is applied to the TARGET, not
// the view: the tracker aims where the target will be (or was) that many
// seconds from now. It is negative for every skill below expert -- the
// shipped comment's own "a negative number lags the target" -- and only
// nightmare leads at +0.1.
//
// The modifier window is a catch-up mode: when the angular error exceeds
// `modifier.max_angle`, the three `modifier.*_scalar` values multiply
// acceleration, stiffness and damping for `modifier.apply_time` seconds.
