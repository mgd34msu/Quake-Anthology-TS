// The bot brain proper: one instance per bot, one `think()` per server
// frame, one usercmd out.
//
// Everything it knows about the world arrives through `BotWorldT`
// (world.ts); everything it knows about how to behave arrives through
// `BotKnowledge` (data/knowledge.ts, the shipped bots/*.txt files) and the
// per-skill `settings_*.txt` block. This ports the common rerelease TS donor
// brain, with Q2 weapon and pickup fields read from its actual source data.
// The private KEX engine's decision implementation is not published in the
// rerelease game sources; those sources supply the named game callbacks.
//
// One frame, in order:
//
//   1. read self, and decay every awareness record with senses.ts
//   2. pick a target, if behaviors.allow_combat and the bot is aware of one
//   3. pick a goal -- the caller's explicit goal first (the QuakeC's
//      bot_movetopoint / bot_followentity), then the target, then the best
//      item behaviors.allow_grab_items lets it want, then a roam
//   4. plan or re-plan a nav path to that goal when the straight line is
//      not good enough
//   5. run the path controller for forward/side/jump
//   6. run the aim tracker toward the target, or toward where the bot is
//      walking when there is no target
//   7. choose a weapon by weapons.txt's own rule and fire when the weapon
//      cone has settled
//
// A GOAL THE NAV GRAPH CANNOT REACH. Picking the nearest valuable item and
// then failing to plan a path to it used to wedge the bot permanently: with
// no path, movement fell into the straight-line steering branch below --
// which has no stuck detection -- and the bot walked into the wall between
// it and the item for the rest of the match, re-picking the same item every
// frame. `unreachableUntil` remembers a goal entity the planner could not
// reach and stops choosing it for a while.
//
// THE "GIVE UP AFTER STUCK_GIVE_UP TRIPS" ESCALATION. This used to count
// trips on `pathState.stuckCount`, which both `clearPath` and `setPath`
// zero -- and the stuck branch below calls `clearPath` on every trip short
// of giving up, so the tally could never reach `STUCK_GIVE_UP` and a bot
// walled off from a reachable goal re-planned the same blocked route
// forever. The tally now lives on the brain itself, as `stuckTrips`.
//
// THE UNSTICK WINDOW. A bot that walked dead-on into a wall has no
// tangential velocity to slide along it with, so it presses forwardmove at
// full speed and does not move a unit -- and re-planning produces the same
// route into the same wall. Every stuck trip opens a short sidestep-and-hop
// window (`unstickUntil`/`unstickSide`) to break contact with the wall.
//
// THE WEDGE TIMER. The unstick window above is opened by the path follower,
// which only watches a path -- and forgives itself every time a point is
// retired or a plan is replaced. A bot bouncing between two points, or one
// steering straight at a goal with no path at all, therefore never tripped it
// and leaned on the same wall for the rest of the level. `wedgeOrigin` is a
// second, plainer test that belongs to the brain: displacement over time,
// whatever the path state is. An oscillation is as stuck as a standstill.
// It is held off while the bot has a target, because a bot circling one has
// small net displacement by design -- see `updateWedge`.
//
// OBJECTIVES. In a game with team-owned `objective` items (Quake 1's CTF
// flags), the enemy's is a goal, a team's own is one only when it has been
// dropped, and a bot carrying one runs it home to where its own objective
// spawned -- which has to be REMEMBERED, because a carried flag stops being
// an entity the world reports at all. Bots split into attackers and
// defenders at the level's start.
//
// COOP. A bot that wanders off never meets the monsters the human is
// fighting, and one pinned to them never clears anything: so it hunts what is
// still standing near the human, and regroups with them on a clock. What it
// may SHOOT is still gated by senses.ts; the hunt only decides where it walks.
//
// Determinism: every random decision goes through the injected
// `BotRandomT`. Two brains with the same seed, fed the same worlds, emit
// the same usercmds.
