# Mod compatibility

Keep each mod in its own directory under the installed or writable content root. See the [README's recommended layout](../README.md). Discovery makes a package selectable; its executable interface, required assets, and authored gameplay still determine whether it can run.

## Early Quake III server modules

The `q3-1.16n-base` profile supports the base server interface in the original 1.16n and 1.17 SDKs. These modules use different player, entity, command, event, and configuration records from later releases. The profile translates their public records while preserving private guest memory.

Place `qvm-compatibility.json` beside the selected mod's packages in the writable overlay. This example applies to the original InstaGib Plus package retained from PlanetQuake:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "modules": [{
    "role": "qagame",
    "artifactPath": "vm/qagame.qvm",
    "artifactDigest": "sha256:5aca191fa970a82829a7e29c8b128594dcebb39e4fe439a852bffa0988b3dcfa",
    "profile": "q3-1.16n-base"
  }]
}
```

The digest identifies the QVM's uncompressed bytes, not its containing PK3. Use a declaration only when the module's SDK interface is established. A digest mismatch fails loading; changing the declaration cannot reinterpret an existing saved game's memory under another profile. Modules without a declaration use `q3-modern`.

This profile supports the legacy server's public game services, callable bot services, and SDK memory/math intrinsics. It translates the SDK's action bits, user commands, chat arguments, and navigation results while retaining the module's own AI. The original InstaGib module initialized its bot library, admitted two bots, and advanced eight seconds of AI and command execution. Its itemless test arena produced no movement; this result does not establish bot navigation or combat.

Legacy client/UI modules and private configuration or powerup meanings remain separate work. Unsupported operations report an error, including deprecated SDK ordinals without a callable interface. The original InstaGib module also ran with the inherited modern client on Q2 geometry, including local firing and saved continuation. These results do not qualify every early mod.

## Independent components

Whole-module execution runs the mod's rules together. Applying one mod feature to another game's weapon requires an executable component binding with clear ownership of source state, callbacks, and effects.

The QuakeC projectile trajectory adapter executes declared source callbacks on built-in Q1, Q2, and Q3 projectile launchers; the [README](../README.md) describes selection and declaration commands. Native DLL and QVM weapon extraction remain separate work. Executing an entire native mod does not establish that its weapon behavior can be attached independently to another launcher.

## Maps and source rules

`--map-game` selects geometry independently from the game module. Shared collision queries adapt geometry to the module's source interface. The game module still interprets authored entities, objectives, scripts, and progression. Unknown entity classes retain their authored keys and reach the selected module; the host does not infer a replacement from a map or mod name.

Local foreign-map support does not make an original network client understand another engine's BSP format. Native-wire admission preserves that distinction.
